# Image Data & Computer Vision

[NotPineapple - Capstone Project](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/Capstone---NotPineapple) - Used Keras with Tensorflow backend and OpenCV to identify images of Pineapples from dataset containing images of multiple fruits.  

[Image Classification - CIFAR-10](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/Image_Classification_CIFAR-10) - Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.  

# Reinforcement Learning

[Train a Smartcab to Drive](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/Training_a_SmartCab_to_Drive) - Applied Reinforcement Learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent.  

# Unsupervised Learning

[Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/Creating_Customer_Segments) - Analyzed customer data and used Gaussian Mixture Model & Pricipal Component Analysis to understand the patterns and divide customers into segments.  

# Supervised Learning

[Finding Donors for CharityML - Predict Income of prospective Donors](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/Finding_Donors_for_CharityML) - Analyzed factors that affect the annual income of prospective Donors based on real census data. Developed Supervised Machine Learning models to predict the likelihood of Income being greater than $50K.
